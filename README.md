We are making a connect four game that will be played in a web page. This connect four game will allow the user to choose between
playing player vs player, player vs ai, or ai vs ai. For the ai move selection we will use a min max algorithm to find the best
possible move. Because we are using a min max algorithm, we will be able to set the difficulty of the ai by selecting the depth of
search used. Some other features we are hoping to add is player name input, color chip selection, and also a five in a row game.
