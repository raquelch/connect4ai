I am adding this onto our Github so we can discuss what anyone has done, or if you feel like you need to explain what you have completed.

I recently added some comments explaining what is happening so if anyone is reading them they can understand what exactly we are doing.
I am sure that it can get confusing if you arent involved in our project.
